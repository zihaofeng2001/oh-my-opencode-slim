## Overview

The **Council agent** sends your prompt to multiple LLMs (councillors) in parallel, then the council agent itself synthesises the optimal answer from all councillor responses.

### Key Benefits

- **Higher confidence** — consensus across models reduces single-model blind spots
- **Diverse perspectives** — different architectures catch different issues
- **Graceful degradation** — the council agent synthesises from whatever councillor results came back
- **Configurable presets** — different council compositions for different tasks

## Quick Setup

### Step 1: Add Council Configuration

Edit `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json` (or `.jsonc`):

```jsonc
{
  "council": {
    "presets": {
      "default": {
        "alpha": { "model": "openai/gpt-5.4-mini" },
        "beta":  { "model": "google/gemini-3-pro" },
        "gamma": { "model": "openai/gpt-5.3-codex" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Use the Council Agent

Talk to the council agent directly:

```
@council What's the best approach for implementing rate limiting in our API?
```

Or let the orchestrator delegate when it needs multi-model consensus.

That's it — the council runs, synthesises, and returns one answer.

## Configuration

### Council Settings

Configure in `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json` (or `.jsonc`):

```jsonc
{
  "council": {
    "default_preset": "default",
    "presets": {
      "default": { /* councillors */ }
    },
    "timeout": 180000
  }
}
```

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `presets` | object | — | **Required.** Named councillor presets (see below) |
| `default_preset` | string | `"default"` | Which preset to use when none is specified |
| `timeout` | number | `180000` | Per-councillor timeout in ms (3 minutes) |
| `councillor_retries` | number | `3` | Max retries per councillor on empty provider response (0–5). Each retry creates a fresh session |

### Councillor Configuration

Each councillor within a preset:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `model` | string | Yes | Model ID in `provider/model` format |
| `variant` | string | No | Model variant (e.g., `"high"`, `"low"`) |
| `prompt` | string | No | Role-specific guidance injected into the councillor's user prompt (see [Role Prompts](#role-prompts)) |

### Constraints

- Councillors run as **agent sessions with read-only codebase access** — they can read files, search by name (glob), search by content (grep), search by AST pattern (codesearch), and query the language server (LSP). They cannot modify files, run shell commands, or spawn subagents. This makes council responses grounded in actual code rather than guessing.
- The council agent itself synthesises the final answer from councillor results using its own model.
- Councillor agents can be configured (temperature, MCPs, skills) via the standard `agents.councillor` override. The model is always set per-councillor in the preset configuration.

---

## Preset Examples

### 1-Councillor: Second Opinion

Use a single councillor when you want a second model's take without overhead:

```jsonc
{
  "council": {
    "presets": {
      "second-opinion": {
        "reviewer": { "model": "openai/gpt-5.4" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**When to use:** Quick sanity check from a different model.

### 2-Councillor: Compare & Contrast

Two councillors with different models:

```jsonc
{
  "council": {
    "presets": {
      "compare": {
        "analyst":  { "model": "openai/gpt-5.4" },
        "creative": { "model": "google/gemini-3-pro" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**When to use:** Architecture decisions where you want perspectives from two different providers.

### 3-Councillor: Balanced Council

The default setup — three diverse models:

```jsonc
{
  "council": {
    "presets": {
      "default": {
        "alpha": { "model": "openai/gpt-5.4-mini" },
        "beta":  { "model": "google/gemini-3-pro" },
        "gamma": { "model": "openai/gpt-5.3-codex" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**When to use:** General-purpose consensus. Good balance of speed, cost, and diversity.

### N-Councillor: Full Review Board

As many councillors as you need — the system runs them all in parallel:

```jsonc
{
  "council": {
    "presets": {
      "full-board": {
        "alpha":   { "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6" },
        "bravo":   { "model": "openai/gpt-5.4" },
        "charlie": { "model": "openai/gpt-5.3-codex" },
        "delta":   { "model": "google/gemini-3-pro" },
        "echo":    { "model": "openai/gpt-5.4-mini" }
      }
    },
    "timeout": 300000
  }
}
```

**When to use:** High-stakes design reviews or complex architectural decisions where maximum model diversity matters. Increase `timeout` since there are more responses to collect.

### Multiple Presets

Define several presets and choose at invocation time:

```jsonc
{
  "council": {
    "default_preset": "balanced",
    "presets": {
      "quick": {
        "fast": { "model": "openai/gpt-5.4-mini" }
      },
      "balanced": {
        "alpha": { "model": "openai/gpt-5.4-mini" },
        "beta":  { "model": "google/gemini-3-pro" }
      },
      "heavy": {
        "analyst":   { "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6" },
        "coder":     { "model": "openai/gpt-5.3-codex" },
        "reviewer":  { "model": "google/gemini-3-pro" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**How to select a preset:**

| Caller | How |
|--------|-----|
| User via `@council` | The council agent can pass a `preset` argument to the `council_session` tool |
| Orchestrator delegates | Orchestrator invokes `@council`, which selects the preset |
| No preset specified | Falls back to `default_preset` (defaults to `"default"`) |

---

### Role Prompts

Councillors accept an optional `prompt` field that injects role-specific guidance into the user prompt. This lets you steer each participant's behaviour without changing the system prompt.

**Councillor prompt** — prepended to the user prompt before the divider:

```
<role prompt>
---
<user prompt>
```

#### Example: Specialised Review Board

Councillors accept an optional `prompt` field:

```jsonc
{
  "council": {
    "presets": {
      "review-board": {
        "reviewer": {
          "model": "openai/gpt-5.4",
          "prompt": "You are a meticulous code reviewer. Focus on edge cases, error handling, and potential bugs."
        },
        "architect": {
          "model": "google/gemini-3-pro",
          "prompt": "You are a systems architect. Focus on design patterns, scalability, and maintainability."
        },
        "optimiser": {
          "model": "openai/gpt-5.3-codex",
          "prompt": "You are a performance specialist. Focus on latency, throughput, and resource usage."
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Without a `prompt`, the councillor uses its default behaviour — no changes to the prompt.

---

## Usage

### Direct Invocation (User)

Talk to the council agent like any other agent:

```
@council Should we use event sourcing or CRUD for the order service?
```

The council agent runs councillors in parallel and synthesises the result directly.

### Orchestrator Delegation

The orchestrator can delegate to `@council` when it needs multi-model consensus:

```
This is a high-stakes architectural decision. @council, get consensus on the database migration strategy.
```

The orchestrator's prompt includes guidance on when to delegate to council:

> **Delegate when:** Critical decisions needing diverse model perspectives • High-stakes architectural choices where consensus reduces risk • Ambiguous problems where multi-model disagreement is informative

### Reading the Output

Council responses include a summary footer:

```
<synthesised answer>

---
*Council: 3/3 councillors responded (alpha: gpt-5.4-mini, beta: gemini-3-pro, gamma: gpt-5.3-codex)*
```

If some councillors failed:

```
<synthesised answer from available councillors>

---
*Council: 2/3 councillors responded (alpha: gpt-5.4-mini, beta: gemini-3-pro)*
```

---

## Timeouts & Error Handling

### Timeout Behaviour

| Timeout | Default | Scope |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `timeout` | 180000 ms (3 min) | Per-councillor — each councillor gets this much time |

Councillors that don't respond in time are marked `timed_out`. The council agent proceeds with whatever results came back.

### Graceful Degradation

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| Some councillors fail | Council agent synthesises from the available results |
| All councillors fail | Returns error immediately |
| Councillor gets empty response | Retries up to `councillor_retries` times with fresh sessions |

### Empty Response Detection

Providers sometimes silently drop requests — returning zero tokens with no error. This is detected automatically:

- **Background tasks** (`@explorer`, `@fixer`, etc.): Empty responses trigger the fallback chain (next model in `fallback.chains`). Controlled by `fallback.retry_on_empty` (default `true`). Set to `false` to accept empty responses without retrying.
- **Council councillors**: Empty responses trigger up to `councillor_retries` fresh sessions (default `3`). Only "Empty response from provider" errors are retried — timeouts and other failures return immediately.

To disable empty-response retry globally:

```jsonc
{
  "fallback": { "retry_on_empty": false }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Council Not Available

**Problem:** `@council` agent doesn't appear or tool is missing

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `council` is configured in your plugin config:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json | grep -A 5 '"council"'
   ```
2. Ensure at least one preset with one councillor is defined
3. Restart OpenCode after config changes

### All Councillors Timing Out

**Problem:** "All councillors failed or timed out"

**Solutions:**
1. **Increase timeout:**
    ```jsonc
    { "council": { "timeout": 300000 } }
    ```
2. **Verify model IDs** — models must be in `provider/model` format and available in your OpenCode configuration
3. **Check provider connectivity** — ensure the model providers are reachable

### Preset Not Found

**Problem:** `Preset "xyz" not found`

**Solutions:**
1. Check the preset name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Verify the preset exists under `council.presets` in your config
3. If not specifying a preset, check `default_preset` points to an existing one

### Subagent Depth Exceeded

**Problem:** "Subagent depth exceeded"

This happens when the council is nested too deep (council calling council, or orchestrator → council → council). The default max depth is 3.

**Solutions:**
1. Avoid patterns where the orchestrator delegates to council, which then delegates back to orchestrator
2. Use council as a leaf agent — it should not be chained recursively

---

## Advanced

### Model Selection Strategy

Choose models from **different providers** for maximum perspective diversity:

| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Diverse providers | OpenAI + Google + Anthropic |
| Same provider, different tiers | `gpt-5.4` + `gpt-5.4-mini` |
| Specialised models | Codex (code) + GPT (reasoning) + Gemini (analysis) |

### Cost Considerations

- Each councillor is one agent session → N councillors = N sessions. Councillors may use multiple tool calls within their session (read, grep, etc.), which increases token usage but grounds responses in actual code.
- The 1-councillor preset is the most cost-effective (1 call total)

### Council Agent Mode

The council agent is registered with `mode: "all"` in the OpenCode SDK, meaning it works as both:

- **Primary agent** — users can talk to it directly via `@council`
- **Subagent** — the orchestrator can delegate to it

This is intentional: council is useful both as a user-facing tool for deliberate consensus-seeking and as a subagent the orchestrator can invoke for high-stakes decisions.

### Customising Councillor Agents

Councillor is a registered agent, so you can customise it using the standard `agents` override system:

```jsonc
{
  "agents": {
    "councillor": {
      "temperature": 0.3,
      "mcps": ["grep_app", "context7"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** The `model` for each councillor is configured per-preset in `council.presets.<name>.<councillor>.model` (see [Councillor Configuration](#councillor-configuration) above). Settings in `agents.councillor` apply to all councillors (temperature, MCPs, skills, etc.) but the model always comes from the preset.

**Defaults:**
| Agent | Model | MCPs | Skills | Temperature |
|-------|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| `councillor` | `openai/gpt-5.4-mini` (fallback only) | none | none | 0.2 |
